# Mapping Earthquakes with JavaScript & APIs

## Overview

As a data visualization specialist at the Disaster Reporting Network, we were asked to build insightful data visualizations with interactive featuring on earthquakes around the world.  Being able to present earthquake information via interactive maps should enable the company to draw people in who might otherwise be bored with information being displayed in a standard list or spreadsheet.

After reading in JSON files containing the latest earthquake information, we used JavaScript to customize and Leaflet/Mapbox to create a map which highlights earthquakes all over the globe.  Earthquake magnitudes are intuitively conveyed using both marker size and color (<span style="color:green">green = mild</span>, <span style="color:red">red = severe</span>).  While this was a good start, we were then asked to add a few more options to the map: tectonic plate location, displays specifically for 4.5+ magnitude earthquakes, and additional maps to choose from.

## Results

### Tectonic Plate Layer

### Major Earthquake Layer
